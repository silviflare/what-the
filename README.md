Powered by technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js, the "What the fuck should I do today?" app offers a seamless and intuitive user experience. We leverage the power of Mongoose and MongoDB for efficient data storage and retrieval, while Express and Node.js provide a robust backend framework to ensure optimal performance.

To enhance the visual appeal and user interface of our app, I incorporate the Material UI framework for elements like buttons, fields and dropdowns. For the rest just all my personal design skills. Additionally, I used React Wrap Balancer to optimize the presentation of the random suggestion and Notistack to provide instant feedback and notifications for a smooth CRUD experience.

It's simple! On the homepage, you'll see a "Random" button that generates exciting and unique activity suggestions with just a click.

Additionally, you can edit and delete activities that you have created, ensuring the accuracy and relevance of the information available.

I prioritize simplicity and user privacy. During the signup process, I only request your email and name, no complex forms. My aim is to provide you with a hassle-free experience, making decision-making effortless and enjoyable.
