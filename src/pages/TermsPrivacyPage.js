          with you about our services. We will never sell or disclose your
          personal information to third parties without your explicit consent,
          except as required by law.

          <br />
          <h2>Data Retention</h2>
          We will retain your personal information for as long as necessary to
          fulfill the purposes outlined in this policy unless a longer retention
          period is required by law.
          <br />
